A work master about the abstract poetry of invisible data hidden in nature and brought visible through the use of cybernetics, DIY machines and bioengineered organisms.  By merging electronic media and citizen science, this research and interactive installation uses bio reporters as a tool to gain understanding of a microbeâ€™s perception of the Anthropocene.
